# Building AGI for Financial Markets

We are a leading algorithmic trading and AI research firm building systems that can automate all our business processes. Large, general trading systems today can be good, but can also be unreliable on the long term, unpredictable on short term, and opaque: we want to make progress here.

We're focusing on trading and research for now, but we anticipate creating many opportunities for commercial and public projects down the road.

Researchers, engineers, and operational leaders with diverse backgrounds form our small, highly collaborative team. We are fully remote, so please check our careers section below if you are interested in working with us.

## Our Principles

The simple scale laws in statistical physics inspire us to do empirically-driven, systematic research. Large-scale networks can be analyzed by evaluating the simplicity of relationships among data, computation, parameters, and performance. These relationships are then used to train networks more efficiently and predictably, and to evaluate our performance.

## This is a competition, we are a team

Our research is highly collaborative and aims to be both top-down and bottom-up in nature. We emphasise the inclusion of everyone - researchers, engineers in determining the direction of our research.

## Come Work with Us!
